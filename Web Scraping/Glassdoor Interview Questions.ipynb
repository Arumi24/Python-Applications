It is very accurate, gives time-specific results as well as long-term, and supports all distributions. However, the computations can take a long time. iii) Historical - Use of historical analysis to calculate future results.

Alternatively, open a new shop if population density has increased. In general, if you want to drive sales, and you are selling the same products in both stores (assuming you can't sell different products since they are franchised), you will want to switch up the low performing products and try something new.\n",

      "UNIT TESTING is a level of software testing where individual units/ components of the software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output. In procedural programming, a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc. In object-oriented programming, the smallest unit is a method, which may belong to a base/ super class, abstract class or derived/ child class. (Some treat a module of an application as a unit. This is to be discouraged as there will probably be many individual units within that module.) Unit testing frameworks, drivers, stubs, and mock/ fake objects are used to assist in unit testing.\n",

The first part was a RoR problem; Devskiller had me download a rails application and get it running on my laptop using a full rails environment and SQLite. It was very in depth and required me to remember how a bunch of really specific technologies worked. ActiveRecord was something I haven't used in years due to my recent exclusive use of NoSQL databases, so it took me a long time to remember how it worked, and upon completion of the assignment a bunch of tests were failing. The tests were Capybara tests, which I've never used before, and even though my app worked these tests constantly failed. I spent about 30 - 40 minutes just trying to get these Capybara tests working by manipulating my HTML so that the Capybara selectors would work, but to no avail. I didn't have time to clean up stuff and do additional testing, and the devskiller results showed that I did indeed do poorly, and it doesn't even show you the results of the additional hidden tests that only the company gets to see, which i'm sure showed I did even worse.

Two managers, a female and man who treated me with the segregation and had a racism behavior despite the fact that he was an immigrant himself with popular face we see a lot in this city. Considering the fact that I was great in the first interview with team leads that were a lot technical than this guy, he started asking me questions that are not usual in the interviews and no one can remember exact code. The whole was not about how technical you are or what you did in past and what were your projects, but find a way to convince anyone in the room that I am not right guy! \n",

      " Write a C program to count the number of 1 bits in an interger\n",
      "Not necessarily a C program (though I'm pretty sure it works in C too). int count_set(int n){ int count=0; //counts the bits while(n!=0){ count++; n=n&amp;(n-1);//clear out the most significant set bit } return count; } This goes through exactly the number of iterations as the number of set bits in n. In the worst case however, it still goes through the loop O(logn) times (there are logn bits in an integer n). Another option, if you have infinite memory, you can create a lookup table containing the number of bits in, say, a nibble (4-bit hex numbers 0 to D). Can increase or decrease this lookup table (8 bit numbers, 12 bit numbers, even something that's not a multiple of 4). Of course, if you have infinite memory, you can create a lookup table that's 2^32 entries long, but that's roughly a billion... I'm assuming something similar could be done in C (if not identical). The 0x prefix refers to a hex number in Java. int count_setTable(int n){ int number=0;//counts set bits int [] count={0,1,1,2, //number of 1s in binary of 0,1,2,3,... 1,2,2,3, // 4,5,6,7,... 1,2,2,3, 2,3,3,4} //.. ...15. //if you use 8 bits, your entries will be number of 1s in binary representation of 0...63 int mask = 0xF; //28 zeros followed by four 1s in hex, basically the number 15 in int //if you use, 8 bits, you could use either 0xFF or 255 //there are 32 bits in an int, so 8 groups of 4 bits for(int i=0; i&gt;4;//shift the bits of n out (would need to shift the copy in if checking against 0) } return number; } Other methods count the set bits one-by-one, ANDing with 1 or 0x80000000 while n!=0 and increasing the count if this AND != 0, and then shifting n 1 position to the right (logical shift) or to the left, respectively.\n",

      " This kind of test doesn't imply any 1-1 interview, nor technical verbose definition, nor any multiple choices, but is rather mainly an online simulation test aimed on your understanding of automated testing. That's what the test is mainly about. The idea is being able to generate 50 successful tokens in a row through username&password login. So in order to get a successful token, you'll first be asked to find a way to generate proper username and password combination to login. A hint... the username and password are the same and are mainly composed of four identical numbers series... At least the combo worked in my case... The next catch is to override a maximum of 10 tries. When you'll reach the 10th you'll probably hit a message saying you've been detected as a bot! A way to override this issue by clearing the cache at 9 and also restarting same session with different fake Selenium drivers and proxies. As proof of success, I also added a line of code enabling to take a print screen jpeg image of each successful token and save it on temp directory, just to make sure. So that was it.\n",

      " What are the main characteristics of object oriented programming?\n",
      "In non-OO programming, there is a very clear delineation between the data and the operations performed on the data, with those operations scattered hither and yon, often in a manner that one might term \"helter skelter\". There is usually little control on the access to the data, and integrity checks are usually the concern of the consumer. In OO programming, the data and the operations performed on the data is considered as one unit. Often the data itself is hidden from access, requiring that operations funnel through accessors (getter and setters) and other similar functions to allow integrity checking to be part of the data model itself instead of relying on the consumer. Further, OO programming promotes considering the problem domain to be an amalgamation of independent pieces that are organized in hierarchical domains, with each piece responsible for its own operation and data.\n",

      "Software Developer Co-Op at Safe Software was asked...\n",
      " What is the difference between deep and shallow copying?\n",
      "In Shallow copying, it is usually only the top 1 class that is replicated. All data that is references by the object being copied remains in place. Thus, you can end up with two conceptually different objects actually referencing (and possibly modifying) the same data space. In a Deep copy, the underlying data is also replicated so that the \"parent\" and the \"copied\" data structures are completely independent of each other. An example might be a linked list that is represented by a list header. IN a shallow copy, you will end up with two headers, \"H1\" and \"H2\" that both reference the same linked nodes. Thus any alteration to the structure of the list in H1 will also be changing the structure of the list H2. In a deep copy, all changes to H1 are constrained solely to H1. H2 will not be affected.\n",

      " Programming task 1 (technical screening): You want to park your bicycle in a bicycle parking area where bike racks are aligned in a row. There are already N bikes parked there(each bike is attached to exactly one rack, but a rack can have multiple bikes attached to it). We call racks that already have bikes attached used. You want to park your bike in a rack in the parking area according to the following criteria: the chosen rack must lie between te first and the last used racks(inclusive); the distance between the chose rack and any other used rack is as big as possible. A description of the bikes already parked in the racks is given in a non-empty zero-indexed array A: element A[K] denotes the postion of the rack to which bike number K is attaced (for 0 <= K < N). The central position in the parking area is position 0. A positive value means that the rack is located A[K] meters to the right of the cetral position 0; a negative value means that it's located |A[K]| meters to the left. That, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the largest possible distance in meters between the chosen rack and any other used rack. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [2..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].\n",

      " Programming task 2 (technical screening): When John gambles at the casino, he always uses a special system of tactics that he devised himself. It's based on always betting in one of two ways in each game: - betting exactly one chip (to test his luck); - betting all in (he bets everything he has). Wins in the casino are paid equal to the wager, so it he bets C chips and wins, he gets 2C chips back. If he loses, he doesn't get any chips back. It was a very lucky day yesterday and John won every game he played, starting with one chip and leaving the casino with N chips. We also know that John pllayed all-in no more than K times. Your task is to calculate the smallest possible number of rounds he could have played. Note: betting just one chip is never cosidered playing all-in. Write a function int solution(int N, int K); that, given an integer N and an integer K, returns the minimum number of rounds that are necessary for John to leave the casino with N chips, having played all-in no more than K times. Example: Given N = 8 and K = 0, the answer is 7. K is 0, so John bets 1 chip in each round. The number of chips were as follows: at the beginning:1 (he bet 1) after 1st round: 2 (he bet 1) after 2nd round: 3 (he bet 1) after 3rd round: 4 (he bet 1) after 4th round: 5 (he bet 1) after 5th round: 6 (he bet 1) after 6th round: 7 (he bet 1) after 7th round: 8 (he bet 1) he played all-in 0 times Given N = 18 and K =2, the answer is 6. The shortest game would be: at the beginning:1 after 1st round: 2 after 2nd round: 3 after 3rd round: 4 after 4th round: 8(all-in) after 5th round: 9 after 6th round: 18(all-in) \n",

      " I was given a code to review. I have fixed bugs in their code, made it work, and put detailed comments to all modified lines of code plus detailed comments outside of the code describing what was done and why. The answer was that their student could not understand the comments. Hm, I guess the student should be taught better and I didn't apply for a teacher position. They refused to give me detailed answer, but after all I wasn't sure I wanted it. What a company where students decide whether to hire seniors. After some thinking I've concluded that I was simply used as a free independent code reviewer. If you are experienced developer, avoid these guys, they will pretend they are hiring you, but in fact will just use you. If you are freshly graduated, lazy and not knowledgeable, you can go there, they will teach you how to illegally make others do your job for you.\n",
      "Thank you for the feedback. As the VP of Engineering, I'm always interested in how our job candidates both perceive the overall interview process and the feedback they receive throughout - regardless of the overall outcome. I'm sorry the interview process wasn’t what you expected, but we use the code review exercise as a great tool to understand how you (as a senior developer) would mentor junior employees, what you look for in coding standards and how you think about things like test coverage and code performance. We aren't looking for the \"right\" answer but instead a conversation and insight into how you develop and what you see as important aspects of quality development. I do want to clarify a few points. First, the code sample is not from our product. It is a made up example to really drive that conversation mentioned above. However, we do appreciate the time you took to do the exercise. Second, while you aren’t looking to be a \"teacher\", we expect all of our senior talent to be able to mentor and teach. That's not negotiable and we take a lot of pride in our open and sharing culture where many methods are used to share best practices, innovative solutions and raise the bar around code quality and performance (including code reviews). That culture also enables us to hire amazing new grads and know that they will both be supported and quickly grow their own skill sets and abilities. We’ll make sure to clarify that in our future job postings. We're pretty proud of the team we've built at Roadmunk and the culture of code quality, teamwork and mentoring that we're fostering and constantly improving. The interview process is defined to showcase that culture and determine how or if a candidate would fit within it. And for the record, the only lazy thing at Roadmunk is the occasional dog that spends the day with us as we work amazingly hard to deliver our industry-leading roadmapping software. I welcome you to reach out to me directly to discuss further and I wish you luck in your job search!\n",

I also stated that there are dozens of math libraries freely available that you can use to solve this problem without wasting any time re-inventing the pencil. I also mentioned that the weirdness of floating point numbers make this a surprisingly non-trivial problem to solve. I explicitly mentioned that I was only going to implement a naive version for the general case in which the quadratic equation is meaningful. They deliberately ignored every one of my disclaimers and zeroed in on my supposedly deficient code. They specifically want you to implement a 100% PERFECT and 100% COMPLETE solution that covers every conceivable permutation of input values -- AND which also runs as fast as possible. They will use your incomplete solution against you and argue that the way you solved this fake problem is supposedly indicative of your total inadequacy as a software developer. Bottom line: they're not hiring. Don't even bother to write anything for that skill test. As soon as you see that this is what they want you to do, just walk away and never talk to them again.\n",

You can see compression as two steps: Modeling and Coding. Modeling is an AI field and is an untractable problem. New compressors are developed improving the way data is modeled.\n",

      " The interviewer started with some small talk. Talked a little bit about my research work. Then went on with technical questions. Openned terminal on his computer. First he asked about if I know anything about zombie process. Then he asked about ‘malloc’. Then he told me, how would I implement a malloc like function in a separate memory space like some PCI connected to the main memory. The question was not very clear to me. I tried to explain how I could implement that memory over the extra connected memory. I am not sure if he was very happy about it. Then he went onto his terminal. A C program was there. Just two lines char* str1 = “string1”; char str2[] = “string2”; He told me to print the two strings. I did and then he told me to change the ‘t’ in both of the string to ‘T’. I told him that we cannot change the first string. He asked me why? I could not tell it clearly. I just showed him that, it generates a segmentation fault. I told it might be in some place in the memory which we cannot edit. He kept asking the question to prove my point. Then gave me hint and let me print the addresses of main, some variables which have higher value sounded like they are in the stack part. Printing the values of main showed very low address which shows that, it’s in the code segment. The char* variable was in a little more higher address which clearly shows that, it is in the data segment, which suggests that we can not edit anything on the data segment. So need to know what’s more there in the data segment? Then he showed some networking terms ip ipconfig ping some more (around 6-7) which I forgot. He told me to explain in short what these functions do. Then he asked me to write a script on python, which will read a file and add all the numbers on the third column. He showed me the file with cat command. It as a space separated text like 1 7 8 9 6 5 5 0 8 8 4 5 7 2 4 6 8 9 0 7 4 5 1 7 9 6 0 3 8 0 1 7 8 9 4 6 8 0 8 6 9 8 6 9 7 0 7 6 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 3 4 8 3 5 1 7 8 9 4 6 8 0 8 6 9 8 6 9 Then he gave me a problem on linked list. The problem was to delete all the nodes with a particular number on it. I just needed to write the main function and call that from the main file. The structure and main file was already written. I just needed to add the function prototype to the *.h file. \n",

I did not receive any response to the 6 questions, only a reply that said \"this is an open-ended exercise, there are not rights or wrongs.\" 4 of my questions had to do with wording in the question. It says \"identify the capacity.\" What does that mean? Capacity normally would mean the entire space, does he mean \"free spaces?\" In his response he also mentioned again \"keeping track of capacity of the lot.\" It says \"control the entry and exit count.\" I don't know what that means. Anyways, my code did keep track of everything, but I don't think the guy even looked at the code.

You're then asked to talk about how you would optimize your solution (you don't have to code this part). I was disappointed that there were no behavioral questions whatsoever (Ex. Tell me about a challenge you've faced, a time you've shown leadership, etc.). The focus is completely on your Java (or C++) skills so I guess if you can solve a few Java problems you're in! Unfortunately I wasn't fluent in Java at the time and so I failed the interview. I felt like that was unfortunate since I've been able to teach myself Java in a relatively short period of time.
